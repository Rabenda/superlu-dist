Row Permutations and Removal of MC64
====================================

The Debian superlu-dist package has removed MC64 support, since MC64
is provided under a non-free HSL licence which does not permit
redistribution.

Upstream configured MC64 as the default algorithm for row permutations
in SuperLU-Dist. We have changed the default in Debian to no row
permutation algorithm (RowPerm=NOROWPERM) instead.

Applications which explicitly select MC64 (RowPerm=LARGEDIAG_MC64)
will halt at runtime with an error message stating that MC64 is not
available.

Alternatively you may select RowPerm=LargeDiag_AWPM (CombBLAS).
Note that CombBLAS only supports square (n√ón) matrices.
